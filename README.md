# MSCr
This R package contains functions for accessing data from the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC). Most of the functions read in data files, as the MSC data is generally formatted to be very difficult for R. The function downloadMSCobs() downloads data directly from the MSC web server. Note that the behavior of the server can change at any time, and may break this function.
