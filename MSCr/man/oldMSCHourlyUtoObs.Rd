\usage{
oldMSCHourlyUtoObs(directory = ".", timezone = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{directory}{Optional. Directory containing all wind files. File names must begin with \option{WIND}. The default is the current directory.}

\item{timezone}{Required.  Required. The name of the timezone of the data as a character string. This should be the timezone of your data, but omitting daylight savings time. Note that the timezone code is specific to your OS. To avoid problems, you should use a timezone without daylight savings time. Under Linux, you can use \option{CST} and \option{MST} for Central Standard or Mountain Standard time, respectively. Under Windows or OSX, you can use \option{etc/GMT+6} or \option{etc/GMT+7} for Central Standard and Mountain Standard time. DO NOT use \option{America/Regina} as the time zone, as it includes historical changes between standard and daylight savings time.}
